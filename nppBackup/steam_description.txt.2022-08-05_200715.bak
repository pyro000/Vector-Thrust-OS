[h1][b] Vector Thrust OS [/b][/h1]

[h1][b] Welcome to the best meta/agility script of Space Engineers. Not only controls rotor-thrusters, it's an entire OS.[/b][/h1]
[b] Fork from VectorThrust2 [/b]

[b] Big thanks to Digi, Whiplash, d1ag0n, feoranis, Malware, and so on to help me with part of the code and solving some problems. [/b]
[b] I cannot rule out my thanks also to 1wsx10, the original author of Vector Thrust 2 and for providing the mayority of the code where this script is working. [/b]

If you have [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=655948251&searchtext=control+module] Control Module [/url] installed in the world, it will unlock some benefits. [b] But now I guess is deprecated [/b]

[h1] Features: [/h1]
[list]
[*] Movement in space and in gravity totally possible with a variety of possibilities, rotors and thrusters more stable, thanks to some maths and a custom sensibility value.
[*] Improved performance considerably, no more stanby/jetpack mode.
[*] All configuration handled in the Custom Data of the Programmable Block.
[*] Fully customizable accelerations, you can switch them like the gears of a car.
[*] Tag assignation for blocks and screens is now fully customizable and really easy to implement.
[*] You can park with landing gears and connectors and assign which batteries and tanks will be set to recharge/stockpile, also turns off all thrusters of the ship if you want it.
[*] Better dampeners and cruise mode.
[*] Improved UI.
[*] Added some utilities to improve the experience in configuration, like Runtime Tracker by Whiplash or SimpleTimerSM by Digi.
[*] If the script is too demanding for a server, you can increase some values in configuration (Skipframes, Frames Where The Script Won't Print, Frames Per Operation: Task Splitter, etc) to reduce average runtime to 0.025ms!
[*] And the list goes on...

Soon there will be a video and more blueprint examples.

[h1] SCRIPT IS TOO HEAVY FOR YOUR SERVER? [/h1]

Don't worry! There's an option I added for that desired low end gameplay, I present you "Skipframes=", each frame is processed, N frames will be skipped, improving performance but making the script less precise the more the value, I recommend putting it no more than 4 in space and 2 in planets. 
Example: Assuming if the frame that will not be processed is [0] and processed [1]. If you set Skipframes to 1, the frames will go like this: [0][1][0][1]...
But if you set it to 3, it will go like this: [0][0][0][1][0][0][0][1]


[h1] VANILLA BUTTONS SETUP [/h1]

1. Get in your Controller (Cockpit, Remote Control), press G.
2. Drag the Programmable Block to the bar and select "Run".
3. Write or paste the argument for your controls. you will need:
* gear
* cruise
* dampeners (If you don't have any normal thrusters available, otherwise use vanilla [Z]).

[h1] CONTROL MODULE SETUP (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)[/h1]
 [b] Inertia Dampeners key (Default Z) [/b]: Inertia Dampeners On/Off.
 [b] Gear key (Default Shift) [/b]:	Increase accelerations saved in the custom data, like a car's gears, similar to "gear" argument.
 [b] Cruise key (Default R) [/b]: Toggle cruise mode, turns off thrusters depending of the controller's direction.
 [b] Toggle park mode (Jetpack Button) (Default X) [/b]: Toggle park mode, if you added a landing gear or connector to the script, you can toggle this to shutdown everything properly and set tanks and batteries to recharge automatically.

[h1] INFO PANEL SETUP [/h1]
[b] While this is Optional, I highly recommend it. [/b]
1. Place a text panel
2. put [b]NameTag[/b]LCD in the name
3. For Controller screens add [b]NameTag[/b]:n , where n can be from 0 to the (length of all screens available - 1).

[h1] BUGS [/h1]
- Sometimes if the thrusters are so strong, at full acceleration, the vector thruster that doesn't have to do anything does a coordinated zigzag pattern, it doesn't affect gameplay or movement at all.
If you want to report a bug go to Issues tab.
- You tell me.

[h1] EXAMPLE UPDATED BLUEPRINTS[/h1]

[h2] Small Grid [/h2]

Most basic one (Space): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2839606252

I like this one (Atmo): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2843960670 
Uses the new math to stabilize that much power.
